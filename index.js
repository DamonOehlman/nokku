  # nokku

  This is a node application container that is similar to and inspired by
  [dokku](https://github.com/progrium/dokku). The primary rationale for
  creating nokku is that I had a couple of OpenVZ containers available to
  me, which is an environment in which [docker](http://docker.io) cannot
  be used (AFAIK).  So nokku was born.
